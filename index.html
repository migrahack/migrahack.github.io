	  				<p class="info"><strong>Secure Communities</strong> is a federal program that began in 2008 by George W. Bush and escalated under President Obama. It required local jails and prisons to collaborate with ICE by holding people for 48 hours for ICE to interview and/or detain for deportation. This essentially forced local municipalities to shoulder the responsibility of federal immigration law.</p>

	  				<p class="subhead">WHAT THIS MEANS</p>
	  				<p class="info">Philadelphia would no longer hold anyone on an ICE detainer nor would the city give notice to ICE of anyone's release from custody without an ICE warrant signed by a judge, effective immediately.</p><br>
	  				<p class="info">Other municipalities across the country had passed orders trying to drive a wedge between the local police and ICE. But in their orders, there were exceptions and loopholes so that detainers could still be honored legally. Being the most progressive, the Philadelphia order closed the loopholes and ended police and ICE collaboration in the city.</p>

	  				<p class="info">On November 14, 2014, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson conceded in a <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/14_1120_memo_secure_communities.pdf" target="_blank">memo</a> that the Secure Communities program essentially failed.</p>
	  				<br>
	  				<p class="info">From the memo: "The program has attracted a great deal of criticism, is widely misunderstood, and is embroiled in litigation; its very name has become a symbol for general hostility toward the enforcement of our immigration laws. Governors, mayors, and state and local law enforcement officials ... have increasingly refused to cooperate with the program, and many have issued executive orders or signed laws prohibiting such cooperation. A number of federal courts have rejected the authority of state and local law enforcement agencies to detain immigrants pursuant to federal detainers issued under the current Secure Communities program."</p>

	  				<p class="info">Almost immediately, Johnson announced the opt-in federal Priorities Enforcement Program (PEP). PEP allows ICE to issue a request to be notificed if someone of interest is in the city's custody and/or when that person will be released. Essentially, this program provided an exception to the seemingly exception-less orders that cities passed in 2014.</p>
